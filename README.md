# Assignment 1: Pair-wise Comparison Using Triangular Fuzzy Sets
The first assignment involved pair-wise comparisons using Triangular Fuzzy Sets (TFS), a method used in fuzzy logic to handle uncertainty in decision-making. TFS represents each element by a triplet (l, m, u), where l is the lower bound, m is the middle, and u is the upper bound. This method allows for modeling imprecise information, which is particularly useful when comparing decision criteria that involve subjective judgments.
Methodology:
A fuzzy pair-wise comparison matrix was constructed, where each comparison between criteria was expressed as a triangular fuzzy number. Following this, normalization and defuzzification were applied to derive priority weights for each criterion, converting fuzzy judgments into numerical values.
Advantages:
Triangular fuzzy sets are computationally efficient and provide an approximation of uncertainty in decision-making processes. They are effective for cases where the level of uncertainty remains relatively stable, making them suitable for various practical applications.
Conclusion:
This approach allowed for the representation of uncertainty in pair-wise comparisons, providing a flexible method to handle subjective judgments. The use of TFS helped derive a priority vector that accounted for imprecision in human assessments.

# Assignment 2: Pair-wise Comparison Using Trapezoidal Fuzzy Sets
In the second assignment, Trapezoidal Fuzzy Sets (TpFS) were used for pair-wise comparisons. TpFS is a more advanced method than TFS, as it represents fuzzy numbers using a quadruple (l, m1, m2, u). The additional middle value enables better handling of variable uncertainty, which is useful when expert opinions differ widely.
Methodology:
A fuzzy pair-wise comparison matrix was developed using trapezoidal fuzzy numbers to represent comparisons. These trapezoidal numbers allowed for a more detailed representation of uncertainty in the expert judgments. The final priority weights were determined by normalizing and defuzzifying the values in the matrix.
Advantages:
Trapezoidal fuzzy sets provide a more accurate representation of uncertainty when the variability in judgments is larger. This method is particularly useful when dealing with a wider range of uncertain values, leading to more precise analysis and ranking of decision criteria.
Conclusion:
By using trapezoidal fuzzy sets, the analysis was able to capture more complex uncertainties in the pair-wise comparisons. This resulted in a more detailed priority ranking, particularly in scenarios with high variability in the data.


# Summary
Each approach—Triangular Fuzzy Sets (TFS) and Trapezoidal Fuzzy Sets (TpFS)—provided distinct advantages depending on the nature of the decision problem and the level of variability in expert judgments.
In the case of TFS, the focus was on simplicity and computational efficiency. The triangular fuzzy set, characterized by its three-point representation, is particularly well-suited for situations where the degree of uncertainty remains relatively uniform across comparisons. The method efficiently handles subjective judgments without requiring excessive computational resources, making it a practical choice for decision-making scenarios that involve moderate levels of uncertainty. Moreover, the straightforward structure of TFS ensures that the defuzzification process results in clear, usable priority vectors, facilitating decision-making even when precise data is unavailable.
Conversely, TpFS introduced a more complex approach, offering a higher degree of accuracy in modeling uncertainty. The trapezoidal fuzzy set, with its four-point representation, allows for a more flexible interpretation of data, particularly in cases where the level of uncertainty varies significantly across different criteria. This approach is particularly valuable in scenarios where expert opinions may fluctuate, as it captures a broader range of possibilities and provides a more refined analysis. The trapezoidal fuzzy method, though more computationally demanding, is better suited for decision problems involving greater variability, offering a detailed and nuanced priority ranking.
In both assignments, the integration of fuzzy logic into the AHP framework was essential for handling the subjectivity and imprecision common in decision-making processes. The use of fuzzy sets enabled the conversion of qualitative judgments into quantitative outputs, thus improving the reliability of the results. TFS provided a more streamlined solution, useful for problems requiring computational efficiency, while TpFS allowed for greater precision in handling complex and variable uncertainties.
Ultimately, the choice between triangular and trapezoidal fuzzy sets depends on the specific requirements of the decision problem. For simpler cases, where the level of uncertainty is relatively stable, triangular fuzzy sets offer an efficient and effective solution. In contrast, when the decision problem involves fluctuating uncertainty or more complex judgments, trapezoidal fuzzy sets provide a more detailed and accurate representation of the expert opinions. Both approaches demonstrate the versatility and robustness of fuzzy logic in enhancing decision-making under uncertainty, making them valuable tools in analytical processes such as AHP.
